<p>- this list at the top
- should be nicely converted
- to a Markdown list :)
</p>

<h1>This section contains lotsa bullets, in lotsa ways!</h1>

<h2>An actual headlined bulleted list</h2>
•item 1
•item 2
•item 3


Almost an 'o':<br>
    ○  item 1   <br>
    ○item 2     <br/>
    ○   item 3  <br />



The times, they are a changin':


× item 1
×   item 2
×     item 3


But they should • only • be converted to asterisks when × not × inline,
see for instance, this "-" should remain the same, as does this "○".
